I'm interested in strong copyleft, free software and open source, in that order.

I write documentation and create small programs.

Generally you can find me on the internet with my full name.

I also have a GitHub Sponsors page, but you are honestly much better off sponsoring other people working on great software projects.

<!-- and yes i literally downloaded 5k+ repositories on bare metal. on windows. my defender was angry. -->
