I'm interested in strong copyleft, free software and open source, in that order.

I write documentation and create small programs.

Generally you can find me on the internet with my full name.

I also have a GitHub Sponsors page, but you are honestly much better off sponsoring other people working on great software projects.

  This was not my original idea, I just merely stole the idea from another person and expanded it. I took something from 5000 and 10000 of GitHub's most starred repos in order, from git star ranking website and pasted them to a powershell script on my desktop that would somehow add them as go dependencies to a project. The source code is lost in time since due to reasons. When downloaded and "installed", it resulted in hash sum that probably "proved" that I indeed did download it using go cli tool. This alone was enough for me to be counted as "using" in GitHub. Since not all repos can be used as go dependencies, it led to funny situations where I was the only "user" of an otherwise beloved tool, such as vim:

I tend to remember this screenshot with words like "Loved by millions, used by one".

Since it contained the majority of bigger repos in GitHub I was basically on the screens of everyone on 1080p 16:9 screens for a while. Luckily I had no harmful intentions on mind and I tried to tell GitHub in Community discussions that this is a vulnerability. Luckily they patched it within a few months. It was glorious and at the same time relatively anxious to be known as the "bear man on everyone's github" in hackathons that year and the year following that. Someone even made a YouTube video of me. I get anxious if there's a chance for someone to be hurt by me or if they could be mad at me which made this whole thing kinda of a burden. And yes I'm aware this kind of empathy might be a problematic trait for a grey hat.

I didn't realize at the time that (of course) top 10 000 most popular repos in GitHub some of the repos contain malware or malware pocs. Although I set my go to download deps on my HDD, Windows Defender still wasn't happy about the content that lived on the HDD after around 48 hours of downloading.
